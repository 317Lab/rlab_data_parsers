Description of Files & Folders
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
archived_summer21: Holds previous versions of GSE code as well as miscellaneous GSE codes generated prior to 2021/08/05 update.  
delamere_extraCode: Another archive folder that contains code that was used and may need to be referenced in analysis of the Delamere rocket.
useful_pyscripts: Collection of useful (OPTIONAL) python scripts for various purposes. (See bellow)
erpabob_data_collection_summer_2021.ipynb: IPython notebook for collecting data from a shield and saving it to a file. 
erpabob_realtime_plot_summer2021_delamere.py: Python script that collects, saves and plots realtime shield data for shields with both original and 10s buffered data in their transmissions (like for Delamere).
                                              NOTE: Must specify data transmission speed in code!
erpabob_realtime_plot_summer2021_stripped.py: Python script that collects, saves and plots realtime shield data for shields with only current data in their transmissions. 
                                              NOTE: Must specify data transmission speed in code!
parse_erpabob_summer2021_delamere.ipynb: IPython notebook for parsing and plotting data files output from erpabob_realtime_plot_summer2021_delamere.py OR erpabob_data_collection_summer_2021.ipynb 
parse_erpabob_summer2021_stripped.ipynb: IPython notebook for parsing and plotting data files output from erpabob_realtime_plot_summer2021_stripped.py OR erpabob_data_collection_summer_2021.ipynb

Master Branch Update Log
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Update 2021/08/05: 
    As a lot of changes were made to the GSE code between summer 2020 and summer 2021, we decided to update the master branch. 
    However, as a lot of extra code had been generated by students in the most recent git branches, much of it had to be archived for neatness and simplicity.
