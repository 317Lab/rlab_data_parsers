##Note that in all cases the Ardunio code had PIN 8 set to LOW initialy and then switched it to HIGH after a set ammount of time (originally 10s but some files may have had that set to 25s or 11s)

dataFile_shield15-NoInter.txt   :   Arduino not plugged in.
dataFile_shield15-NoInter-v2.txt : Arduino pugged in but PIN 8 not set as output and not called in code loaded on Arduino 
dataFile_shield15-
    *long_Inter.txt OR *Inter_long.txt  :   Arduino code left PIN 8 on HIGH after switching it from LOW to HIGH.
    *Inter-500.txt                      :   Had 500 entries in recorded interupt array. 
    *<#>s_Inter.txt OR Inter_<#>s.txt   :   Arduino code turned off PIN 8 (i.e. set to LOW) after <#> seconds on HIGH.
